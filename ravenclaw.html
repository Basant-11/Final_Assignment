		<h1><p align="center">Ravenclaw</p></h1><hr><br><br>
		<p class="def"><font size="4">Ravenclaw is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw.[1] Members of this house are characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol is an eagle, and blue and bronze are its colours.[6] The Head of Ravenclaw is Filius Flitwick, and the house ghost is the Grey Lady, real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.</font></p><br><br>
<div class="right"><img src="H:\Desktop files\IT Assignment\New folder\PICTURES UESD\rcss.png" alt="logo"></div>
<p class="def"><font size="4">Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air, and it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen; blue and bronze represent the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air. The Ravenclaw points hourglass contains blue sapphires.</font></p><br><br>
<p class="def"><font size="4">Ravenclaw values intelligence, knowledge, curiosity, creativity and wit. Its emblematic animal is the eagle, and its colours are blue and bronze. The Ravenclaw Head of House in the 1990s was Filius Flitwick. The ghost of Ravenclaw is the Grey Lady, who was the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, the House's founder.Ravenclaw corresponds to the element of air. The Ravenclaw common room and dormitories are located in a tower on the west side of the castle. Ravenclaw students must answer a riddle as opposed to giving a password to enter their dormitories. This riddle, however, can be answered by non-Ravenclaws. Famous Ravenclaws include Luna Lovegood, Gilderoy Lockhart, Ignatia Wildsmith (inventor of Floo powder), and Garrick Ollivander.</font></p><br><br>
<h1>Traits</h1>
<div class="background left"><img src="H:\Desktop files\IT Assignment\New folder\PICTURES UESD\rc.jpg" alt="logo">
<p class="def "><font size="4">Ravenclaw House prizes learning, wisdom, wit, and intellect in its members. Thus, many Ravenclaws tend to be academically motivated and talented students. They also pride themselves on being original in their ideas, and methods. It is not unusual to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different types of magic that other houses might shun.[7] Hermione Granger, an extremely intelligent witch and the top student in her year, was sorted into Gryffindor, though she admitted that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered placing her in.</font></p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
</div>
<p class="def "><font size="4">Often hard-working and diligent, as often is the case with intellectuals with a predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle are known to be inclined to dismiss certain social expectations for the sake of satisfying their own intellectual curiosity. Some of these eventually also ended up being not only accepted but even celebrated, in spite of being initially subjected to scorn for their various oddities. Luna Lovegood, for example, was one such student: Eccentric to put it at its mildest, she was a Ravenclaw student who initially was bullied for her open defiance of conventionality, but ultimately became a celebrated wizarding naturalist and renowned for her participation in the legendary Battle of Hogwarts and past membership in Dumbledore's Army. Another example would be Professor Filius Flitwick, a half-goblin who might have faced scorn for his short stature earlier in life but went on to become a renowned Duelling Champion, and subsequently one of the finest and most knowledgable Charms Masters in the entirety of the wizarding world during his employment at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. (The best, according to some of his students).</font></p><br><br>
<h1>Reputation</h1><hr>
<p class="def "><font size="4">According to Slytherin prefect Gemma Farley, Ravenclaws are so competitive when it comes to academic success that they are known to backstab each other, and likely other students, in order to get top marks. While Hufflepuff prefect Gabriel Truman noted that they are so proud of the success of famous members, such as Laverne de Montmorency, that they claim any intelligent wizard as a member of Ravenclaw House, such as Bridget Wenlock, who was, in fact, a Hufflepuff. Some Ravenclaws, such as Uric the Oddball, Xenophilius Lovegood, and his daughter Luna Lovegood are also noted to have a propensity towards eccentricity.</font></p><br><br>
