		<h1><p align="center">Gryffindor</p></h1><hr><br><br>
		<p class="def"><font size="4">"You might belong in Gryffindor,
Where dwell the brave at heart,
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
Set Gryffindors apart"</p><br><br>
<div class="right"><img src="H:\Desktop files\IT Assignment\New folder\PICTURES UESD\ggf.jpg" alt="logo"></div>
<p class="def"><font size="4">Gryffindor is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, and determination, to be sorted into his house. The emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick" is the House ghost.</font></p><br><br>
<p class="def"><font size="4">Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of fire, and it is for this reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house.The colour of fire corresponds to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat.</font></p><br><br>
<h1>Traits</h1>
<div class="background left"><img src="H:\Desktop files\IT Assignment\New folder\PICTURES UESD\go.jpg" alt="logo">
<p class="def "><font size="4">The Gryffindor house emphasises the traits of courage as well as "daring, nerve, and chivalry," and thus its members are generally regarded as brave, though sometimes to the point of recklessness. Some Gryffindors have also been noted to be short-tempered. Notably, Gryffindor house contributed many members to Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix, although this may have been because the main members made it a point not to associate with other houses.</font></p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
</div>
<p class="def "><font size="4">According to Phineas Nigellus Black, members of other houses, particularly Slytherin, sometimes feel that Gryffindors engage in "pointless heroics." Another Slytherin, Severus Snape, considered many Gryffindors to be self-righteous and arrogant, with no regard for rules.</font></p><br><br>
<h1>Reputation</h1><hr>
<p class="def "><font size="4">Gryffindors and Slytherins have shared a fierce house rivalry since their founders, Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin, respectively, had a severe falling out over Slytherin's emphasis on blood purity. There might also be an element of feeling wronged, as Harry and his fellow Gryffindors tend to win in a lot of circumstances which, when viewed from a neutral point of view, may be considered unfair. Examples of this include the last-minute points awarded by Headmaster Dumbledore at the Leaving Feast, which conveniently put Gryffindor ten points ahead of Slytherin in the 1991â€“1992 school year, the fact that no points were deducted for the rule breaking that happened during that night and Harry being permitted by Professor McGonagall to have his own broomstick for the Gryffindor Quidditch team even though first-years are not normally permitted their own broomsticks because of danger.</font></p><br><br>
